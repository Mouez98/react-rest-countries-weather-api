## Overview

### About App

This application gives some information about all countries in the world:

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Css Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - For routes
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [React Spinners](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spinners)

### What I learned

I had a lot of fun in this challenge and I was able to learn how to:
- use **Router v6** and manage the error pages
- use **Styled Components** and how to write nested css or Media **Queries** inside it
  ```js
  const DivExample = styled.div`
    max-width: 32rem;
    background-color: var(--ele);
    transition: .4s ease-out;
    &:hover {
      transform: scale(1.1);
    }
    @media (max-width: 460px) {
      width: 100%;
    }
    h2 {
      margin-bottom: .8rem;
    }
  `;
  ```
- manage dark/light mode through **ThemeProvider** and global styles
  ```js
  import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components';
  import { darkTheme, lightTheme, GlobalStyles } from './theme';
  ```
- set image fit with the css property `object-fit: cover;`
  ```css
  img {
    aspect-ratio: 3.3 / 2;
    object-fit: cover;
  }
  ```

I practiced a lot with **React custom hooks** and learned how to:
- create a loading while retrieving the data
- save the chosen light-dark theme mode in the **localStorage**

Initially I had some problems in the details page because React didn't update the page content because I rightly didn't set the listening on the parameter that changed. 

### Continued development

Despite my extensive research I still have to figure out how I can create a preload at render time while react builds the page so that the "hops" due to `reset.css` are not seen as soon as the app is opened.

I also want to understand how to show an upload on the single image as it is uploaded.
